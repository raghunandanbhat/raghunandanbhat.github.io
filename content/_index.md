# Raghunandan Bhat

I'm a Software Engineer working on databases.

I like \[Distributed\] Database Systems, Programming Languages, Open Source Software and a little bit of Machine Learning. When I'm not writing code, I'm usually watching F1 or messing around with beekeeping.

Sometimes I write here, checkout [blog](/blog).
